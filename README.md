# Delphi-Corners
Original implementation of Who Moves Faster (Corners) game on Delphi from 2003 year

Ukrainian-languaged only.

I assummed it had some AI Implemented, but when I run the game and checked the source code, I have discovered that there were no AI implemented for this game in 2003.

There was some special version implemented/dedicated to former coworker of my mother, which didn't have the options to undo and redo turns.

Also there was general release version which included options to undo and redo turns and had some stub to choose opponent but options to select AI were disabled because they were never implemented
